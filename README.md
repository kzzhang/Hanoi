# Hanoi
Manual and Automatic implementation of the classic Towers of Hanoi problem: 
Try to move all rings from the first tower to the third tower. However, rings may only be stacked such that small rings may only go on larger rings.
The program contains a GUI and is easy to access with click and drag functionality.
The number of rings is adjustable. There is also an option that recursively solves the problem for you. The .exe provided may be run directly.

Created using C++ on DevC++ IDE. Uses ApClasses and Allegro.
